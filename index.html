				<div class="half-width" id="left-blurb">
                   <p>
                    I've made my home base in Boston, Massachusetts not too far from where I grew up. I've been on a journey to find a way to turn my desire to create into a career and that is how I found my way to tech. I love writing, photography and art, and was eager to find a way to share my work with the world. I started out just messing around on Wordpress and then found myself watching hours of tutorials on HTML and CSS and was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
                   </p>

				<div class="half-width" id="right-blurb">
                    <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.

                    <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                    <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                    <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
